# Portfolio Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Exact replication of Aakash Rajbanshi's portfolio design as shown in the provided screenshots. No creative liberties or modifications allowed - maintain pixel-perfect accuracy to the original design.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Theme Primary Colors:**
- Background: Very dark gray/black (approximately 210 5% 8%)
- Secondary background: Slightly lighter dark gray (210 5% 12%) 
- Text primary: Light gray/white (0 0% 90%)
- Text secondary: Medium gray (0 0% 70%)
- Accent color: Yellow/gold (45 100% 60%) for highlights, active states, and key elements
- Border/divider: Dark gray (210 5% 15%)

### B. Typography
- Primary font: Clean, modern sans-serif (similar to Inter or system font)
- Heading hierarchy: Bold weights for names and section titles
- Body text: Regular weight, good readability on dark background
- Contact info and metadata: Slightly smaller, secondary text color

### C. Layout System
**Two-column layout structure:**
- Left sidebar: Fixed width (~300-350px) containing profile information
- Main content area: Remaining width for page content
- Consistent spacing using units of 4, 6, 8, and 12 (p-4, m-6, gap-8, etc.)
- Cards and sections use consistent padding and margins

### D. Component Library

**Sidebar Components:**
